# Souls-Soapstone
A Souls games message simulator

Currently hosted in heroku.com (since 30th January 2021): https://souls-soapstone.herokuapp.com/


TODO:
start the remaining souls games message systems (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls I, Dark Souls II and Bloodborne).
<!-- Reminder: make sure you can't submit edited messages to the DB (maybe by changing the sendToDB function in ds3.js) -->
<!-- make it so all templates submitted AND ALL TEMPLATE PAGES use index combinations to form the words instead of it being a string so that injections can't be done -->
<!-- protect backend from injections -->
<!-- one idea is using a template.json that has all words in it, and use that to decode the messages that will be just numbers like 12 and 12345 for simple and conjunction templates  -->
